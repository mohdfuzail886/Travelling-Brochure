                Switzerland is a small mountainous country located in central Europe. This
                landlocked country is about the size of New Jersey and is between France
                and Italy. It is also bordered by Austria, Germany, and Liechtenstein.
                Most of the population lives in the plateau which is between the high Alps
                in the south and the Jura mountains in the north. The mountainous area in
                the south is sparsely populated.
            </p>
            The climate is moderate with no excessive
            heat, cold or humidity. From July to August the daytime temperature range
            is 18 to 28 °C (65° - 82° F) and from January to February the range is -2
            to 7 °C (28° - 45° F). In spring and autumn, the daytime temperature range
            is 8 to 15 °C (46° - 59° F). Depending on the altitude the temperature
            range may vary. It is highly recommended to visitors to pack a sweater,
            good walking shoes, sunscreen, sunglasses, a compact umbrella and/or a
            light rain coat.
            </p>

                Switzerland is home to numerous mountains which are over 3,000 meters high. A beautiful experience for
                hikers is the Chamonix-Zermatt Haute Route, a 12-day classic Alpine trek that will bring you straight to
                the well-recognized Matterhorn.

                <h3>Some Helpful Tips</h3>
                <li>
                    <em>Train Travel - There is just so much to know when trying to understand the whole train situation in
                        Switzerland and how everything works. For that I put together this guide to train travel in
                        Switzerland. So have a look at that for a more in depth focus on the topic.
    
                        Trains (and all other public transportation) are by far the most convenient and easy way to get from
                        one place to the next within the country so you will definitely want to have a good sense of it
                        before you go.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Weather - Another very important topic is the weather situation in Switzerland - most notably around the alps. For that I also put together an all in Switzerland weather guide to better prepare you all things weather related</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>When To Go - After deciding that you want to visit Switzerland, the next question will be when to actually visit. That answer will really depend on what you want to do.

                    If visiting cities only, then that can be done at any time of year obviously with the winter months being much cooler.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em> Lightly - Going off of that last point with what to pack for a trip to Switzerland, you should also consider packing as lightly as possible. If you are staying solely in one or two places throughout your trip you probably do not need to heed that advice.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Travel on a Budget - Even though Switzerland is one of the more expensive countries in the world to visit, it can be done on a budget (to an extent). Your main three costs once in the country will be trains, accommodations and food.</em>
                </li>
            </ul>
